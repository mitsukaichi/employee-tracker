## About this project

This project was done as an assignment in the UC Berkeley coding bootcamp full stack engineering class. This application was built from scratch to meet the following criteria:

- Show these options:  view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
- view all departments: department names and department ids
- view all roles: the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
- view all employees: a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
- add a department: prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
- add a role: prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
- add an employee: prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
- update an employee role: prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
- Update employee managers.
- View employees by manager.
- View employees by department.
- Delete departments, roles, and employees.
- View the total utilized budget of a department, in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

## Thigs I learnt from this challange

- Different ways to handle the object returned from the SQL - use the call back function or create a new Promise object
- How to query, insert, update and delete data in the database using SQL
- Query or modify database by joining multiple tables or a single table that contains the id field that references the id in the same table 
- How to use the promise object imported from another file or used within another function
